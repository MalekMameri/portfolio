# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## Setup Complete! ðŸŽ‰

Your project is now configured for GitHub Pages deployment. Here's what was set up:

### What was configured:

1. **Added `gh-pages` package** - for automated deployment
2. **Updated `package.json`** with:
   - `homepage` field pointing to `https://malekmameri.github.io/portfolio/`
   - `predeploy` script to build the client
   - `deploy` script to publish to gh-pages branch
3. **Updated `vite.config.ts`** with `base: '/portfolio/'`
4. **Updated `.gitignore`** to allow dist folder for deployment

### To deploy your site:

1. **First time setup on GitHub:**
   - Go to your repository settings on GitHub
   - Navigate to "Pages" in the sidebar
   - Set "Source" to "Deploy from a branch"
   - Select "gh-pages" branch and "/ (root)" folder
   - Click "Save"

2. **Deploy your site:**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

This will:
- Build your React app with the correct base path
- Create a `gh-pages` branch automatically
- Push the built files to that branch
- Deploy to `https://malekmameri.github.io/portfolio/`

### Important Notes:

- The `gh-pages` branch will be created automatically on first deployment
- Your site will be available at `https://malekmameri.github.io/portfolio/`
- Any future deployments just need `npm run deploy`
- The deployment process takes a few minutes to become live

### Troubleshooting:

If you get a 404 error, make sure:
1. The repository name matches exactly: `portfolio`
2. GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
3. The `gh-pages` branch exists and contains the built files

Happy deploying! ðŸš€
